![MARO LOGO](./docs/source/images/logo.svg)
MARO(Multi-Agent Resource Optimization) is a multi-agent resource optimization platform, which is an end-to-end solution for both academic research and industry application. A super-fast and highly extensible simulator system and a scalable distributed system are provided, which can well support both small scale single host exploration and large scale distributed application. Some out-of-box scenarios, algorithms and related baselines are provided for a quick hands-on exploration.
