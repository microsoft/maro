## Notes

- Check Style

  Please make sure lint your code, and pass the code checking before pull request.

  We have prepared a configuration file for isort and flake8 to lint.

  ```sh
  # Install isort.
  pip install isort

  # Automatically re-format your imports with isort.
  isort --settings-path .github/linters/tox.ini

  # Install flake8.
  pip install flake8

  # Lint with flake8.
  flake8 --config .github/linters/tox.ini

  # Install editorconfig-checker.
  pip install editorconfig-checker

  # Lint with editorconfig-checker.
  # PATH: Directory or file path of your changes.
  editorconfig-checker --config .editorconfig PATH

  ```
