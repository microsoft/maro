cdef class SnapshotList:
    """List of frame snapshot for ticks (frame index), usually used to query states.

    SnapshotList is read-only for out-side of simulator, it provides a slice interface to query states
    for nodes at specified ticks (frame index).
    Same as frame, snapshot list is composed with serveral nodes, you should get snapshot list for
    a node with node name, before querying,then use the slice interface to query.

    Slice interface accept 3 parameters:

    - Tick/tick_list (frame index).
    - Node_index/node_index_list.
    - Attribute_name/attribute_name_list.

    Tick and node_index can be empty, then means all the ticks (frame index) or all the nodes.

    When querying, all the slot of specified attribute will be returned.
    The querying result is a 1 dim numpy array, and grouped like:
    [[node[attr] for node in nodes] attr for attr in attributes] * len(ticks)

    NOTE:
        Slice interface returns a 1-dim numpy array, you may need to reshape it as your requirement.
        Also the attribute must defined in specified node, or will cause error.

        Invalid tick (frame index) will be padding in return value,
        that means all the value for that tick (frame index) will be 0, and will not cause error.

    Examples:

        .. code-block:: python

            # Suppose it contains 'yournodes' and 'mynodes' in definition.
            frame = MyFrame()

            # Get snapshots of 'mynodes' node.
            my_snapshots = frame.snapshots["mynodes"]

            # Query attributes states from snapshot list.
            # Get values of all 'mynodes' node at all the tick.
            my_value_at_all_tick = my_snapshot[::"value"]

            # Get values of all 'mynodes' node at 1st tick.
            my_value_at_1st_tick = my_snapshot[0::"value"]

            # Get values of all 'mynodes' node at [0, 2, 3] ticks.
            my_values = my_snapshot[(0, 2, 3)::"value"]

            # Get all value of 1st 'mynodes' node at 1st tick.

cdef class FrameBase:
    """Base object used to define frame in backend, any frame that need to be hosted in backend should inherit from this.

    Usually a frame is composed with serveral nodes (NodeBase), a snapshot list if enabled.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Normal frame definition.

                super().__init__(self, enable_snapshot, total_snapshots=snapshot_number, backend_name="static or dynamic")

    Currently we support 2 kinds of backend implementation for frame: static and dynamic. Dynamic backend support list attribute
    which works list a normal python list, but only can hold decleared data type.

    The snapshot list is used to hold snapshot of current frame at specified point (tick or frame index), it can be
    configured that how many snapshots should be kept in memory, latest snapshot will over-write oldest one if reach
    the limitation, this is useful when the memory is not enough.

    When defining a frame, number of node must be specified, this may not suitable for all the case, such as the node number
    is dynamic generated after initializing, this is a workaround to fix this that use function wrapper to generate frame
    definition at runtime.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Using function to wrap the frame definition to support dynamic node number.
        def gen_frame_definition(my_node_number: int):

    After initializing, frame will generate instance list for all the nodes, these list can be accessed
    by their definition name, each node instance will be assigned an index attribute (0 based) for later quering.

    inherit from this class.

    A node is composed with serveral attributes that defined with NodeAttribute class with data type and slot number.

    A node must have a name that used to query states in snapshot list, this name is specified via ``@node`` decorator.

    NOTE:
        A node definition must decorated with ``@node`` decorator to specified a name, or will cause error.

    To add an attribute in node definition, just add class variable that type is NodeAttribute to your node class.

    .. code-block:: python

            # A fixed size float array.
            my_float_array_attr = NodeAttribute("f", 2)

    Each attribute will have a default hook than will trigger an event after the value changed, to recieve this event
    there should be a specified method that named as ``_on_<attribute name>_changed`` in node definition class,
    this method will recieve the new value as its only parameter.

    .. code-block:: python

    Same as frame definition, if you need dynamic slot number, you use a function that wrap a node defnition too.

        Do not create instance of nodes by yourself, it will cause error, as each node need to know about frame.

                my_float_array_attr = NodeAttribute("f", float_attr_number)

            return MyNode

    After frame initialzing, we can access these attribute via frame node instance list for this node type.

    For attributes which slot number is 1, you can access it as normal python object property.

    .. code-block:: python

        f = MyFrame()

        # Get MyNode instance list.

        # Access predefined attributes.
        print(mnode_1.my_int_attr)

    For attributes that slot number greater than 1, we provided a slice interface to make it easy to access.

    NOTE:
        Accessing attributes that slot number greater than 1 should alway use slice interface, cannot assign value to them
        directly, this will cause error.
