Grass Cluster Provisioning on Azure
===================================

With the following guide, you can build up a MARO cluster in
`grass mode <../distributed_training/orchestration_with_grass.html#orchestration-with-grass>`_
on Azure and run your training job in a distributed environment.

Prerequisites
-------------

* `Install the Azure CLI and login <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest>`_
* `Install docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`_ and
  `Configure docker to make sure it can be managed as a non-root user <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user>`_

Cluster Management
------------------

* Create a cluster with a `deployment <#grass-azure-create>`_

  .. code-block:: sh

    # Create a grass cluster with a grass-create deployment
    maro grass create ./grass-azure-create.yml

* Scale the cluster

  .. code-block:: sh

    # Scale nodes with 'Standard_D4s_v3' specification to 2
    maro grass node scale my_grass_cluster Standard_D4s_v3 2

  Check `VM Size <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes>`_
  to see more node specifications.

* Delete the cluster

  .. code-block:: sh

    # Delete a grass cluster
    maro grass delete my_grass_cluster

* Start/stop nodes to save costs

  .. code-block:: sh

    # Start 2 nodes with 'Standard_D4s_v3' specification
    maro grass node start my_grass_cluster Standard_D4s_v3 2

    # Stop 2 nodes with 'Standard_D4s_v3' specification
    maro grass node stop my_grass_cluster Standard_D4s_v3 2

Run Job
-------

* Push your training image

  .. code-block:: sh

    # Push image 'my_image' to the cluster
    maro grass image push my_grass_cluster --image-name my_image

* Push your training data

  .. code-block:: sh

    # Push data under './my_training_data' to a relative path '/my_training_data' in the cluster
    # You can then assign your mapping location in the start-job deployment
    maro grass data push my_grass_cluster ./my_training_data/* /my_training_data

* Start a training job with a `deployment <#grass-start-job>`_

  .. code-block:: sh

    # Start a training job with a start-job deployment
    maro grass job start my_grass_cluster ./grass-start-job.yml

* Or, schedule batch jobs with a `deployment <#grass-start-schedule>`_

  .. code-block:: sh

    # Start a training schedule with a start-schedule deployment
    maro grass schedule start my_grass_cluster ./grass-start-schedule.yml

* Get the logs of the job

  .. code-block:: sh

    # Get the logs of the job
    maro grass job logs my_grass_cluster my_job_1

* List the current status of the job

  .. code-block:: sh

    # List the current status of the job
    maro grass job list my_grass_cluster

* Stop a training job

  .. code-block:: sh

    # Stop a training job
    maro grass job stop my_job_1
