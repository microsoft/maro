RL Toolkit
==========

MARO provides a full-stack abstraction for reinforcement learning (RL) which includes various customizable
components. At the top level of a training workflow are:

* Learner, which consists of a roll-out manager and a training manager, is the controller for a learning
  process. The learner process executes training cycles that alternate between data collection and policy
  updates.   
* Rollout manager, which is responsible for collecting simulation data. The ``LocalRolloutManager`` performs roll-outs
  locally, while the ``MultiNodeRolloutManager`` manages a set of remote ``Actor``s to collect simulation data in parallel.
* Training manager, which manages a set of policies and controls their updates. The policy instances may reside in the
  manager (``LocalTrainingManager``) or be distributed on a set of remote nodes (``MultiNodeTrainingManager``) for parallelized
  training.
* roll-out worker, which consists of an environment instance and a set of policies that agents use to interact with it, is a
  remote roll-out worker instance managed by a ``MultiNodeRolloutManager``.

Environment Wrapper
-------------------

To use the training components described above, it is necessary to implement an environment wrapper for the environment of
your choice. An environment wrapper serves as a bridge between a simulator and the policies that interact with it by providing
unified interfaces to the interaction workflow. It is also responsible for caching transitions and preparing experiences for
training. Key methods that need to be implemented for an environment wrapper include:

* ``get_state``, which encodes agents' observations into policy input. The encoded state for each agent must correspond
    to the policy used by the agent.
* ``to_env_action``, which provides model output with context so that it can be executed by the environment simulator.
* ``get_reward``, for evaluating rewards.

Policy
------

A policy is a an agent's mechanism to choose actions based on its observations of the environment.
Accordingly, the abstract ``AbsPolicy`` class exposes a ``choose_action`` interface. This abstraction encompasses
both static policies, such as rule-based policies, and updatable policies, such as RL policies. The latter is
abstracted through the ``AbsCorePolicy`` sub-class which also exposes a ``update`` interface. By default, updatable
policies require an experience manager to store and retrieve simulation data (in the form of "experiences sets")
based on which updates can be made.


.. code-block:: python

  class AbsPolicy(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def choose_action(self, state):
          raise NotImplementedError


  class AbsCorePolicy(AbsPolicy):
      def __init__(self, experience_manager: ExperienceManager):
          super().__init__()
          self.experience_manager = experience_manager

      @abstractmethod
      def update(self):
          raise NotImplementedError


Core Model
----------

In the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) world, a core policy usually includes one or more neural-network-based models,
which may be used to compute action preferences or estimate state / action values. The core model abstraction is designed
to decouple the the inner workings of these models from the algorithmic aspects of the policy that uses them. For example,
the actor-critic algorithm does not need to concern itself with the structures and optimizing schemes of the actor and
critic models. The abstraction consists of ``AbsBlock`` and ``AbsCoreModel``, both of which subclass torch's nn.Module.
The ``AbsBlock`` represents the smallest structural unit of an NN-based model. For instance, the ``FullyConnectedBlock``
is a stack of fully connected layers with features like batch normalization, drop-out and skip connection. The ``AbsCoreModel``
is a collection of network components with embedded optimizers. Subclasses of ``AbsCoreModel`` provided for use with specific
RL algorithms include ``DiscreteQNet`` for DQN, ``DiscretePolicyNet`` for Policy Gradient, ``DiscreteACNet`` for Actor-Critic
and ``ContinuousACNet`` for DDPG.

The code snippet below shows how to create a model for the actor-critic algorithm with a shared bottom stack:

.. code-block:: python

  class MyACModel(DiscreteACNet):
      def forward(self, states, actor=True, critic=True):
          features = self.component["representation"](states)
          return (
              self.component["actor"](features) if actor else None,
              self.component["critic"](features) if critic else None
          )


  representation_stack = FullyConnectedBlock(...)
  actor_head = FullyConnectedBlock(...)
  critic_head = FullyConnectedBlock(...)
  ac_model = SimpleMultiHeadModel(
      {"representation": representation_stack, "actor": actor_head, "critic": critic_head},
      optim_option={
        "representation": OptimizerOption(cls="adam", params={"lr": 0.0001}),
        "actor": OptimizerOption(cls="adam", params={"lr": 0.001}),
        "critic": OptimizerOption(cls="rmsprop", params={"lr": 0.0001})  
      }
  )

To generate stochastic actions given a batch of states, call ``get_action`` on the model instance: 

.. code-block:: python

  action, log_p = ac_model.get_action(state)

To performing a single gradient step on the model, call the ``step`` function: 

.. code-block:: python

  ac_model.step(critic_loss + actor_loss)

Here it is assumed that the losses have been computed using the same model instance and the gradients have
been generated for the internal components.  


Experience
----------

An ``ExperienceSet`` is a synonym for training data for RL policies. The data originate from the simulator and
get processed and organized into a set of transitions in the form of (state, action, reward, next_state, info),
where ''info'' contains information about the transition that is not encoded in the state but may be necessary
for sampling purposes. An ``ExperienceManager`` is a storage facility for experience sets and is maintained by
a policy for storing and retrieving training data. Sampling from the experience memory can be customized by 
registering a user-defined sampler to it.  


Exploration
-----------

Some RL algorithms such as DQN and DDPG require explicit exploration governed by a set of parameters. The
``AbsExploration`` class is designed to cater to these needs. Simple exploration schemes, such as ``EpsilonGreedyExploration`` for discrete action space
and ``UniformNoiseExploration`` and ``GaussianNoiseExploration`` for continuous action space, are provided in
the toolkit.

As an example, the exploration for DQN may be carried out with the aid of an ``EpsilonGreedyExploration``:

.. code-block:: python

  exploration = EpsilonGreedyExploration(num_actions=10)
  greedy_action = q_net.get_action(state)
  exploration_action = exploration(greedy_action)
